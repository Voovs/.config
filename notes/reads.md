# Programming reads!
### Uncategorized
    https://mzucker.github.io/
Machine learning blog. Has an article for solving
    http://www.ilikebigbits.com/index.html
Blog touching on programming in general, written by an industry expert
    https://marksaroufim.medium.com/machine-learning-the-great-stagnation-3a0f044e17e0
Another ML blog, looking social aspects of programming machines
### Shell
    https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-part-1-navigating-the-command-line/
Tutorial style blog for software development. Notably, his Effective Shell
series is great
    https://www.rockyourcode.com/
Blog has several articles on shell usage. What makes it unique is being written
by a tax officer and a very nice dark mode
### Rust focus
    https://matklad.github.io/
Blog about rust and other programming stuff. Pretty technical, though has a
casual tone.

    https://os.phil-opp.com/
Blog about building an operating system in rust

    https://fasterthanli.me/series
Really long blog series, almost like courses, with rust. Generally lower level
programming than found in most blogs. Suggested by Jonhoo

    https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/
Next step after the book, as suggested by Jonhoo. Seems like general
post-beginner level rust programming

    https://www.zero2prod.com/
An entire book for backend development in rust!

    http://intermezzos.github.io/book/first-edition/preface.html
Walk through of building an operating system in rust. Seems really good for just
learning \*nix system development in general

### Rust books
    https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html
Plenty of small rust project examples. Suitable for beginners
    https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html
Get started with command line applications in rust
    https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/
Get started with bare-metal programming in rust
    https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/
Get started with web assembly in rust

### Rust workshops
    6.824 Distributed systems https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-mr.html
Technically not limited to rust, though just a great course for low level
systems development
    https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop/
Get started learning procedural macros with David Tolnay's workshop! This is a
pretty niche corner of rust, effectively working like a compiler extension.
